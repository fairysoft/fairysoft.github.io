# [WIP] Jordan Tremaine's IT Portfolio


### About me

In 2017 I was a 25 year old retail manager staring down Amazon’s Australia launch, while the business I worked for stagnated in the new climate. 

After traveling I decided to leave, and settled into a pathway in Heavy Mechanics. The pace was slow, and the culture didn't mesh.

So when an acquaintance asked me to manage the creation of his IT startup I lept. Using technology to achieve business results sparked a passion. A year later I was back at school doing a Cert IV and then a Diploma at South Metro TAFE.


### Introduction

This is a portfolio to highlight my achievements in 2019, and my aspirations for the future.

# Core Strengths

## Scripting

I regularly look for opportunities to automate processes and collect data using scripts. I've used PowerShell to assemble complex file structures, audit objects, and script user creation in AD and Office 365. I've used Python to scrape data from Cisco APs using telnet, process results and email accordingly.

Built an executable that calculated an addressing scheme when provided subnet requirements.

Built a multi-threaded P2P game ‘Kings vs Boars’. Users play against each other using sockets over TCP, while the GUI displays in game events and player statistics. Both the GUI and TCP required multi-threading for loop concurrency. 

```
“Project was very ambitious and congratulations on producing an entertaining game. I can see you have worked very hard, have demonstrated required skills and used your imagination to extend your skills into advanced areas” 
```
-Lyndy Vella, Python Lecturer


   
## Networking

I approach network protocols with a deep dive mindset. This enables a logic driven approach to configuration and troubleshooting, to ensure business capability. 

During my year at TAFE I implemented over 50 protocols across the OSI reference model to build a variety of SOHO and fortified small enterprise networks. Setting up site-to-site IKEv2/IPSEC VPN with a single IP through NAT was the highlight of these builds.

My homelab consists of a Ubiquiti Edge Router and PFSense Firewall each with a Cisco 3560 L3 Switch for segregation based on zone and VLAN.

```
“Your submission is of high standard. Please keep it for future references. It shows the amount of time and the depth of your research in answering the questions” 
```
-Billy, Networking Lecturer

```
“Stunning...Your answers reflect in-depth understanding of concepts well beyond requirements and show how hard you have worked” 
```
-Lyndy Vella, Integrated Projects Lecturer

## Cloud and Office 365

Based on work experience at ‘That Computer Shop’ in Nedlands that heavily favoured O365, I was inspired to go above and beyond during Diploma to match the skill set businesses need.

Administered 25 user O365 Tenancy using Business Premium Trial. Used O365 PowerShell Modules and scripts to swiftly configure Tenancy security settings not available in the GUI or Azure, and to automate tasks. 

Setup DMARC, DKIM and ARC in Office 365 exchange, as well as S/MIME using x.509, for both the desktop and online versions of Outlook. These are critical technologies for Email Security, and I am able to understand and apply them to reduce phishing attempts. 

Completed AWS Academy Cloud Foundations in December 2019 to understand Cloud Fundamentals benefits and cost management.

```
“Very good understanding of concepts and implications of technology” 
```
-Lyndy Vella, Enterprise Communication Lecturer

```
“For a new student of Office 365 I was impressed by the knowledge and insights he gained so quickly, I’ve called him several times to ask for his input on technical issues like Hybrid environment syncing”
```
-Tim Haley, IT Technician SEDA Group

```
“Epic Jordan, your detailed analysis of the protocols is outstanding and the diagrams are stunning. Really beautiful work”
```
-Lyndy Vella, Enterprise Communication Lecturer



## Documentation
I pride myself on clear and detailed documentation because it’s essential for efficient network management, auditing and troubleshooting. During studies I used ITILv4 for schema reference, and was the only student to submit through GitHub.

Of all lecturer feedback 24.4% were compliments of professional presentation, and 6.7% was directed at high documentation standards. During volunteering I used PDQ and IT Glue to assist in documentation processors. 


```
“By far, one of the best quality documentation sets I have received in an assessment”
```
-Natalie Yan, Business Lecturer

```
 “Really good idea to document on GitHub...well documented peer reviewed”
```
-Lyndy Vella, Integrated Projects Lecturer*

# More?

**Deployment**

At John Curtin College of the Arts I imaged over 40 laptops using MDT. During semester break at SMTAFE I assisted in the reimaging of 100+ desktops using PXE boot to their WDS. 

During CERT IV I was the only student to setup a WDS server with Windows 1809, and it would auto join to domain. When challenged to create a small business solution I used DISM. For software packages I used Group Policy.

**NAS and Redundancy**

During Diploma I setup a RAID6 NAS solution running from FreeNAS and had backups scheduled using Windows Server Backup and Veeam. During Cert IV I used Iperius and Urbackup. 

```
“Excellent work...great photos and written documentation...it was great how you discussed security and redundancy (veaam)”
```
-Daniel Wozencroft, NAS Lecturer

**Security**

Implemented syslog running on CentOS, Splunk, and Libre SNMP to visualise and correlate network event information for security and troubleshooting applications. Setup DMARC, DKIM, ARC, S/MIME for email security. Setup remote to site VPN, and site to site VPN with IKEv2/IPSEC. Used NIST Security Framework and CISCO Safe framework during projects, and investigated many protocol handshakes, DHKE being my favorite.

```
“You have developed a security managers mindset...Very good explanations of technology...Great packet analysis for VPNs too. Very impressive” 
```
-Lyndy Vella, Integrated Projects Lecturer

**Virtualisation**

Used vSphere to setup 2 ESXI hosts and 1 VCenter server. Designed resource pools, implemented vMotion and had guest OS’ scheduled backup to Veeam. Overcame a fatal vCenter bug that prevented access through clearing JSON caches using the CLI. I did this at home in my dev environment and shared the answer to the class. 

Used Server Hyper-V to populate a small enterprise environment with a number of guests, solved all virtual networking issues for my group and I deploy a similar environment in my homelab for fun. 

```
“This was a great read and I appreciate the amount of time and effort you went into completing the project report...I can not fault your work” 
```
-Daniel Wozencraft, Virtualisation Lecturer

**Safety and Legal**

Knowledge of fair use rules, patent, trademark, registered design, and copyright ensures media produced by myself complies with organisational policy and the Copyright Act of 1968. 

As I designed a Privacy Policy for a fictional company that complies with the Privacy Act of 1988 and the 13 Australian Privacy Principles I am aware of the compliance issues businesses adhere to. 

Because I created a Code of Ethics, Grievance Procedure and Conflict of Interest process for a fictional business I understand compliance builds trust with the community and stakeholders, and helps employees navigate challenges. 

In my position of duty manager at Big W I was first aid qualified, responsible for OSH and created hazard incident reports as required. During TAFE I chaired the WHS Committee Meetings and became familiar with OSH Act 1984, and OSH Regulations 1996. I also hold a valid White Card.
