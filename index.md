### Introduction

This is a portfolio to highlight my achievements in 2019, and my aspirations for the future. 

## Core Strengths

### Documentation
I pride myself on clear and detailed documentation because it’s essential for efficient network management, auditing and troubleshooting. During studies I used ITILv4 for schema reference, and was the only student to submit through GitHub.

Of all lecturer feedback 24.4% were compliments of professional presentation, and 6.7% was directed at high documentation standards. During volunteering I used PDQ and IT Glue to assist in documentation processors. 

    “By far, one of the best quality documentation sets I have received in an assessment”*

    “Really good idea to document on GitHub...well documented peer reviewed”*
